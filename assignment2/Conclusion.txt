The conclusion drawn by the group is that despite the fact that 8 well selected
instructions are enough to implement any decidable algorithm, the amount of time
and efforts required by programmers to program simple arithmetic operator such
as a multiplier is both extremely important and error(s) prone.

One can easily observe by comparing the exercise 9 of the lab 1, the exercise
3.1 of this lab and the exercise 3.2 of this lab that : the bigger the
instructions set is, the smaller the code becomes. Making it both more readable
and more maintainable as the verification process is delegated to the hardware
designers. In addition, as the multiplication operator in IS[2] takes the same
amount of cycles per instruction than the others, no overhead is introduce and
therefore, no trade-off has to be found.
